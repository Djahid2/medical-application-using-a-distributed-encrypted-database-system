# üë®üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Design and implementation of a medical records management application using a distributed, encrypted database system.
 This project focuses on developing a secure medical records management system using a locally **distributed**, **encrypted** database. The application ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive patient information, aligning with modern data security standards in the healthcare sector.

Additionally, the system includes a user authentication and access management feature, allowing authorized users to log in through the application interface with the necessary credentials, ensuring proper access control.

## Prerequisites 
- **React**
- **Nodejs**
- **mongodb**
- **Docker**
  
## Required Dependencies
- body-parser: Middleware to handle incoming request bodies.
- cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- crypto: Library for cryptographic functionality.
- dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
- express: Web framework for building APIs.
- mongodb: Official MongoDB driver for Node.js.
- mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- nodemailer: Module for sending emails from Node.js.
- Installation Command
- Run the following command in your project directory to install all dependencies:

```
npm install body-parser cors crypto dotenv express mongodb mongoose nodemailer
```
## üóÑÔ∏è Distributed Database Setup

The application uses a locally distributed MongoDB setup with multiple instances running on different ports:

- **Database1** ‚Äì `localhost:27018` ‚Üí mapped to container port `27017`
- **Database2** ‚Äì `localhost:27019` ‚Üí mapped to container port `27017`
- **Database3** ‚Äì `localhost:27020` ‚Üí mapped to container port `27017`
- **Database4** ‚Äì `localhost:27021` ‚Üí mapped to container port `27017`
-
